Using docker assumes that you have it installed.

Instructions for that are available here: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Building docker image
```
sudo ./build.sh
```

### Running docker image
```
sudo ./run.sh --station-address="<IP OF YOUR WEATHER STATION>"
```
